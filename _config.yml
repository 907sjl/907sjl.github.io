  <p>I'm currently in a data analytics group focused on healthcare data engineering 
  and visualization projects. I work with both clinical and financial customers to transform 
  data into actionable information, using a mix of SQL, Python, HTML, CSS, Bokeh, 
  Power BI, QlikView, and Cerner CCL.</p>
  <p>A few of my projects are listed to the right with links to their repositories. All of these 
  are deidentified examples with fabricated data.</p>
