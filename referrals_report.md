## Specialty Clinic Referral-To-Appointment Rates

**Project description:** One way to measure access to care is timeliness.  Long delays to see a healthcare provider can speak to availability issues, either a lack of resources or inefficiencies that result in a less than optimal conversion of referrals into appointments. Long delays can also speak to accomodation issues or accessibility issues if patients have difficulty attending their scheduled appointments.
This project is an example of a report that I created to look at the wait times for referred patients at specialty clinics. 

### Volume and throughput of referrals for a clinic

The measures in this report sample all referrals sent to a clinic and age each referral from the date it was sent to the date it reached each milestone in the referral management process. If a referral has yet to reach a milestone it is aged to the date of the report. 

There are two process aims displayed in this report: one for urgent referrals to be seen in five days, and one for routine referrals to be seen in 30 days.  Referrals are aged to the appropriate number of days for each aim and reported in the month when they reach that age. Any referral not canceled, rejected, or administratively closed is included in the measures. The report shows the percentages of referrals meeting the process aims vs. the target and comparisons against the three-month rolling average and 12-month rolling average.

The percentages of referrals accepted, scheduled, seen, and completed are calculated for all referrals that reach 90 days of age during the month.  Median times to reach each milestone are also shown. 

### Performance and improvement across clinics

This report seeks a concise way to communicate the impact of recovery plans or the need for recovery plans to improve patient wait times. It compares the performance rates for the current month, rolling three-month average, and rolling 12-month average against the target rate for a process aim. This gives an indication of how consistently each clinic is meeting targets and maintaining that performance. One month under target may not be cause for concern, and one month above target may need to be celebrated and encouraged for continued performance. 

To get an indication of improvement direction within each clinic, this report compares the performance rate for the current month to the previous month, rolling three-month average, and rolling 12-month average rates for the same clinic. If the clinic consistently performs but is moving down over time that should be investigated, and if a clinic consistently underperforms but is consistently rising that might indicate a working recovery plan that should be sustained. 

Stoplight colored indicator arrows represent the performance and improvement direction for each clinic over time to communicate at a glance. The report also categorizes each clinic based on the combination of up or down arrows to infer meaning via a concise statement.
