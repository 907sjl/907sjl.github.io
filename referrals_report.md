## Specialty Clinic Referral-To-Appointment Rates

**Project description:** One way to measure access to care is timeliness.  Long delays to see a healthcare provider can speak to availability issues, either a lack of resources or inefficiencies that result in a less than optimal conversion of referrals into appointments. Long delays can also speak to accomodation issues or accessibility issues if patients have difficulty attending their scheduled appointments.
This project is an example of a report that I created to look at the wait times for referred patients at specialty clinics. 

### Volume and throughput of referrals for a clinic

The measures in this report sample all referrals sent to a clinic and age each referral from the date it was sent to the date it reached each milestone in the referral management process. If a referral has yet to reach a milestone it is aged to the date of the report. 

There are two process aims displayed in this report: one for urgent referrals to be seen in five days, and one for routine referrals to be seen in 30 days.  Referrals are aged to the appropriate number of days for each aim and reported in the month when they reach that age. Any referral not canceled, rejected, or administratively closed is included in the measures. The report shows the percentage of referrals meeting the process aims vs. the target and comparisons against the three-month rolling average and 12-month rolling average.

The percentages of referrals accepted, scheduled, seen, and completed are calculated for all referrals that reach 90 days of age during the month.  Median times for each milestone are also shown with a distribution of referrals across categories of wait time to be seen.
